## Watch

Run `ng serve` , navigate to `localhost:4200`

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

When using this project, you will notice the varables that are used in templates are declared `public`. Reason is that production build uses ahead of time compilation and for that to work all properties used in templates must be public. You can build without AOT by using `ng build -prod --aot=false`.
